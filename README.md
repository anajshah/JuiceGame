LIGHTHOUSE
Team Members: Aariana Shah

How would you pitch your game in one line? A first-person game where players navigate a labyrinthine basement beneath a lighthouse, haunted by a deranged keeper who tries to find them.

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? The game combines survival elements with escape room puzzles, where players must explore, hide, and craft tools to escape the keeper's grasp.

How does the game actually play? Players explore the maze-like basement, solve puzzles to unlock new areas, avoid or distract the old lighthouse keeper, and gather items to craft their escape.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? Mainly just exploration and solving puzzles.
